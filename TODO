Make rounds a seperate class

Currently, individuals persists for the length of a round. If this is the case,
we need to reset their memory every game. Perhaps we should have individuals
persist only for the length of a match? Maybe we should have two classes, one
which stores the individual's genome, and one which stores it's memory?
